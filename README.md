# Caesar Cipher 🔐

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** — one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
It can **encode** (encrypt) and **decode** (decrypt) messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a given number.

## Features
- Encode (encrypt) a message
- Decode (decrypt) a message
- Keeps non-alphabet characters (spaces, numbers, punctuation) unchanged
- ASCII art logo included 😃
- Loop to restart program until you choose to quit

---

## How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a given number (the "shift").  
For example, with a shift of 3:  
- `a → d`  
- `b → e`  
- `c → f`  

So, the word **"hello"** becomes **"khoor"** with a shift of 3.
